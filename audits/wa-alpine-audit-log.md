# WA Alpine/Mountaineering Audit Log

Recurring fact-audit of Washington alpine/mountaineering routes in the live Supabase DB.
Scope: `routes.discipline in ('alpine','mountaineering')`, WA (`id like 'wa_%'`), restricted to
routes whose parent `areas.area_type = 'peak'` (excludes crags/walls mislabeled with an
alpine/mountaineering discipline — see notes below). At audit start there were 422 routes in
scope out of 557 total WA rows tagged alpine/mountaineering.

## 2026-07-27 — Pass 1, Batch 1

Checked 8 routes (one per distinct peak, first 8 alphabetically): Liberty Bell Mountain (A
Servant To Liberty), Burgundy Spire (Action Potential), Agnes Mountain (West Route), Alpine
Lookout (Round Mountain Trail), American Border Peak (Southeast Face/South Ridge),
Amphitheater Mountain (North Ridge), Anderson's Thumb (Standard Route), Apex Mountain/Pasayten
(Apex Buttress).

**Confirmed errors → fixes in `sql/2026-07-27-batch-1.sql`:**
- Amphitheater Mountain: prominence 807 ft → 758 ft (Wikipedia).
- Agnes Mountain: prominence 1394 ft → 1355 ft (Peakbagger + Wikipedia agree).
- Action Potential (Burgundy Spire): `face` said "North Face", should be "East Face" — the
  route's own overview text already said East Face; the field contradicted the row's own prose.
- Apex Mountain: elevation 8307 ft → 8302 ft, prominence 1013 ft → 982 ft (multiple sources
  agree; the route's own waypoints already used the correct 8302 ft).
- A Servant To Liberty (Liberty Bell): "no documented repeats" claim was wrong — Alex Honnold
  has repeated the route per the FA account; fixed `crowds`/`data_quality` text. Also fixed a
  stale Blue Lake Trailhead/Northwest Forest Pass reference in `access`/`partner_requirements`
  that didn't match this route's actual East Face roadside-pullout approach (no pass required
  there) — a prior 2026-07-18 fix caught the waypoint but missed these fields.

**Flagged for human review (not auto-fixed — judgment calls or unverifiable):**
- American Border Peak (Southeast Face/South Ridge): no errors found, everything checked out.
- Amphitheater Mountain / North Ridge: the route's 1973 FA date and technical grade could not
  be verified (Mountain Project blocked fetches this session).
- Agnes Mountain: elevation (8131 ft stored) conflicts across sources (8119 vs 8133 ft) —
  needs a human to pick a source of record.
- Alpine Lookout: discipline is stored as "mountaineering," but every external source (WTA,
  USFS, Mountaineers, AllTrails) and the route's own beta describe a non-technical Class 1
  trail hike to a fire lookout. Possible misclassification — left to a human, since it's a
  categorization call rather than a single verifiable fact. Prominence (1184 ft) also couldn't
  be independently confirmed (peakbagger/listsofjohn blocked fetches).
- Burgundy Spire: elevation (8483 ft stored) vs. listsofjohn.com's 8492 ft — a 9 ft gap, not
  clearly wrong (could be datum/rounding), left for a human with guidebook/topo access.
- Anderson's Thumb: no GNIS/USGS/Peakbagger/Mountain Project entry exists for this micro-
  feature at all, so elevation/prominence/coordinates are unverifiable against any authoritative
  source (already self-flagged LOW confidence in the DB). Separately, the route's own
  `corrections` text describes it as a "Washington North Cascades peak," which contradicts the
  area's own hierarchy (it's in the Olympics) — flagged for a human to fix the wording since we
  didn't have the exact stored string in hand to safely target with SQL.
- **Apex Mountain / Apex Buttress — flagged as the most significant open issue.** No source
  found documents a technical buttress route on Apex Mountain; every source describes the
  mountain's only route as a Class 1–2 walk-up. The route row also contradicts itself
  (`pitches: 7` vs. its own `rope_note` calling it "Single-pitch 5.9 trad"). This may be a
  conflation with the real, nearby Cathedral Peak Southeast Buttress. Not deleted or altered —
  recommend a human review whether this route entry should exist at all.

Next batch will continue alphabetically from `wa_apex_buttress` (see progress file).
