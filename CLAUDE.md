# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Commands

```bash
npm install        # install deps (React 18 + Vite)
npm run dev        # local dev server with HMR
npm run build      # production build to dist/ (runs check:refs + check:hooks first)
npm run preview    # serve the built dist/ locally
npm run check:refs # identifiers referenced but never bound (runs in build + CI)
npm run check:hooks# React hooks-rules violations (runs in build + CI)
npm run check:ui   # drives the real app in Chrome and asserts per-screen invariants
```

There is no unit test suite, linter, or type checker. The three `check:` scripts are
what stands in for one, and they target the failure mode this codebase actually
ships: not a build error, but a screen that renders wrong or not at all.

- **`check:refs`** parses with Babel and fails on any identifier with no binding in
  an enclosing scope — the bug that blank-screened production in #317 and #359.
  It runs inside `npm run build`, so it gates CI too. Keep
  `scripts/undefined-refs-baseline.json` empty.
- **`check:hooks`** catches hooks called outside a component body — the #377 bug
  (an invalid hook call inside a click handler). Also gated by `npm run build`.
- **`check:ui`** spawns a dev server, walks 12 screens in headless Chrome, and
  asserts: nothing blanked, no uncaught page errors, no `NaN`/`undefined`/`null`/
  `[object Object]` in rendered copy, and named sections still present. It is
  **not** wired into `deploy.yml` — browser automation is too slow and flaky to
  sit in front of production deploys. Run it by hand before merging anything that
  touches the render tree. `--snapshot before.json` / `--snapshot after.json` dumps
  per-screen text so you can prove a refactor is behaviour-neutral; only the clock
  inside ASPECT & SUN should differ between two runs.

Landmark assertions in `check:ui` match whole lines, never substrings — a
substring test passes `"RACK"` on the strength of `"ROUTE TRACK"`, which is exactly
how a live section gets deleted while the check stays green.

Pushing to `main` (or `master`) triggers `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`, which builds and publishes `dist/` to GitHub Pages at https://barbs2989.github.io/Climbing-App/. `vite.config.js` sets `base: "/Climbing-App/"` to match the repo name — this must stay in sync with the repo name or asset links break on Pages.

## Architecture

This is **ClimbMatch**, a mobile-first social app for finding climbing partners, planning objectives, and sharing route conditions. The entire application is a single React component file.

- `index.html` → loads `main.jsx` → renders `<App/>` from `ClimbMatch.jsx`.
- **`ClimbMatch.jsx` (~2400 lines) is essentially the whole app.** It is written in a deliberately dense, single-line-per-declaration style (many `const`s and components packed onto one physical line). Expect very long lines; use `grep -n` with the symbol name rather than scrolling.

### A real Supabase backend exists, but most of the app still runs on in-memory seed data

A `USE_DB` flag (`lib/supabase.js`, on when `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`/`VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`/`VITE_USE_DB=true` are all set) gates a real DB path: `lib/db.js` (`useAreaRoutes`, `submitContribution`, `dbRouteToCamel`) and `lib/DbAreaBrowser.jsx` back the Climbs tab's area browser + route list from Supabase's `areas`/`routes` tables, which hold Washington's full alpine + rock catalog (thousands of routes — see `BACKEND.md` for the schema and pipeline). `lib/auth.js`/`lib/AuthModal.jsx` provide real login. See `BACKEND.md` for what's DB-backed vs. still simulated.

Everything else — crews, messages, connections, vouches, logs, trip reports, and any state outside a DB-backed route's own fields — is still **seeded from module-level `const` arrays/objects at the top of the file and lives only in React state for the session** (refreshing resets everything). Key seed data structures:

- `ROUTES` — the in-memory climbs fallback/demo set (each has an `id`, `mountainId`, grade, `activity`/trip reports, gear, hazards, GPX points, etc.). DB-backed routes bypass this via `dbRouteToCamel()`.
- `MOUNTAINS` — a **hierarchical area tree** (world → country → state → range → canyon → peak/crag/wall) linked by `parentId`, for the in-memory fallback. Routes reference areas via `mountainId`. `inArea(mid, sid)` walks parents to test membership; `areaPathNames(mid)` builds the breadcrumb. The DB-backed path uses the equivalent `areas`/`routes` tables and `ltree` instead.
- `CLIMBERS` / `FILLER_CLIMBERS` — other users; `ME` is the current user. Not migrated to the DB yet (see the note below on real profiles).
- `DEMO_FILLERS` — a boolean toggle that gates a lot of seed content (clubs, crews, my-climbs, etc.). Turning it off empties those sections.

`ME`, and the globals `UNITS` and `DLOCALE`, are **mutated directly** (not via `setState`) inside `App` — e.g. `ME.objectiveIds = wishlist` at the top of the component (~line 2212). Be aware that some state lives on these mutable module globals rather than purely in hooks.

> **Do not write to `ME` directly.** Profile/user state is owned by React hooks (`wishlist`, `myAvail`, `profile`, and the `editDraft`/`saveEdit` flow) — always update it through those setters (`setWishlist`, `setProfile`, etc.). The existing `ME.* = ...` assignments at ~line 2212 are a legacy sync hack that copies state back onto the global each render so the rest of the code can read `ME`; they are not a pattern to extend. Mutating `ME` directly is invisible to React, won't trigger a re-render, and creates a second source of truth that silently drifts from the hooks.

### The single `App` component

`export default function App()` (near the bottom, ~line 2208) holds **~100 `useState` hooks** and every screen. Navigation is driven by a single `tab` state string. Main tabs:

- `today` — home dashboard (greeting, recent condition reports, your crews, suggestions).
- `routes` — explore climbs by area, and (when `selRoute` is set) the route detail screen. Route detail has its own sub-`tab` state: `overview`, `conditions`, `planner`, `safety`, `photos`, `ranks`.
- `discover` — find partners or crews (`partnersMode` toggles `"partners"` / `"crews"`).
- `crew` — your crews and direct/crew messaging (`crewView`).
- `logbook` — your objectives, completed climbs, trip reports.
- `me` — profile, settings, verification, trust score.

`openRoute(x)` is the standard way to navigate into a route (sets `routeFrom`, `selRoute`, and `tab="routes"`).

### File layout within `ClimbMatch.jsx`

Read it in three bands:

1. **Top (~line 1–815): constants + pure helpers.** The `C` object is the shared dark-theme color palette used everywhere via inline styles (there are no CSS files or Tailwind). Domain helpers live here: `catOf`/`tripOf` (discipline categorization), `compat` (partner compatibility scoring), `scarfHrs`/`techHrs` (time estimates), `sunReadout`/`aspectDirs` (sun/shade by wall aspect and time of day), `buildConsensus` (aggregates trip reports into conditions consensus weighted by `trustScore`), `gpxDownload`, `passesFilters`, `distMiles`, `fuzzyMatch`.
2. **Middle: presentational components** — small functions like `DiscBadge`, `TrustBadge`, `VerifyBadge`, `RiskBadge`, `ProvenancePanel`, `RouteGearCheck`, `ElevChart`, `GPXMap`, `DiffRadar`, plus icon components (`DiscIcon`, `ActionIcon`).
3. **Bottom: `App`** — all stateful screen logic and the big inline-JSX render tree, gated by `tab===...` and `selRoute`.

### Domain concepts to know

- **Trust & safety** is a first-class theme: `trustScore`/`safetyScore`, vouches, belay catch ledgers, `VERIF` verification states, `RISK_LEVELS`, `SAFETY_ESSENTIALS`/`WATCH` (per-discipline safety advice), and float plans on crews.
- **Crews** are trip parties around a `routeId` with members, proposed `dates`/`dayAcks`, and a "Ready" state computed by `datesAgreed`/`agreedDate` (everyone confirmed + a day everyone acked).
- **Conditions consensus** is derived, not stored: `buildConsensus(route.activity)` weights reports by reporter trust and recency (`RECENT_DAYS`, `isRecent`) and extracts top condition tags, hazards (`HAZARD_TAGS`), and best months.

### Key algorithms (the computational core)

Four functions do the real work; everything else is UI around them. The code is the source of truth for the exact constants/formulas — these are just pointers.

- `compat(a, b)` (~L335) — partner compatibility score (clamped 20–99) from shared disciplines, grade closeness, shared objectives, verification, pace (`hikingSpeedFtHr`), and availability overlap.
- `buildConsensus(activity)` (~L344) — distills a route's trip reports into a conditions summary, weighting each report by the author's `trustScore` and recency; separates all-time vs recent tags and surfaces hazards.
- `datesAgreed(c)` / `agreedDate(c)` (~L382/384) — a crew reaches "Ready" only when every confirmed member (including ME = id `0`) has acked the same proposed day (`dayAcks`).
- `scarfHrs(...)` + `techHrs(...)` (~L336/337) — planner time estimates: Naismith-style approach time (fitness tier + pack weight) plus pitch-by-pitch climbing time (exponential slowdown by grade).

## Working in this codebase

- When adding a feature, follow the existing pattern: add seed data to the relevant top-level `const`, add `useState` in `App`, and add a `tab===...`/sub-view branch in the render tree. Match the dense, inline-style formatting of surrounding code.
- Styling is always inline `style={{...}}` referencing the `C` palette — do not introduce CSS files or a styling library.
- For anything outside the DB-backed routes/areas/contributions/auth path (crews, messages, connections, vouches, logs, trip reports, etc.), "saving" means updating React state — don't reach for storage APIs unless explicitly asked to add persistence. For DB-backed data, use the existing `lib/db.js`/`lib/supabase.js` patterns (e.g. `submitContribution`) rather than writing new ad-hoc persistence.

### One-off scripts that touch Supabase

Import `scripts/lib/supabase-env.mjs` — do not hand-roll env loading. The
credentials are split across two gitignored files (`SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY` in
`.env`, the `VITE_*` url/anon key in `.env.local`), so a script that reads only
one file gets `undefined` for the other half. That fails silently in the worst
way: PostgREST accepts a PATCH sent with the anon key and returns **200 with an
empty array**, because RLS rejected every row. The write reports success and
changes nothing.

Pass `{ pageSize: 1000 }` to `selectAll` for anything scanning the whole `routes`
table — the default 60 means ~3,400 round trips and takes over ten minutes.

- `requireServiceKey()` throws instead of degrading to the anon key. Use it for anything that writes.
- `patchRow(table, id, body)` throws unless exactly one row came back, so a wrong id or an RLS rejection can't read as success.
- `selectAll(table, select, filter)` paginates by keyset. Offset paging over a filtered, unindexed column times out on the 200k-row `routes` table, and an unordered `.range()` silently skips/duplicates rows.

After any batch write, re-read the affected ids and reconcile counts. A 200 is not evidence the data changed.

### Hand-written SQL pasted into the Supabase SQL Editor

`patchRow` only guards writes that go through a script. Structural changes here are
routinely handed to the user as copy-paste SQL, and that path has no such guard: the
SQL Editor reports **success for an UPDATE or DELETE that matched zero rows**. Success
means the statement parsed, not that anything changed.

**Run `npm run check:sql -- fix.sql` before handing any .sql file over.** It reads the
live DB and fails on:

- target ids that do not exist — the statement would report success and do nothing
- a `DELETE` removing the last row with that name on its peak — the only copy
- files or statements large enough to be truncated on paste

On 2026-07-28 five fixes were reported applied that had matched nothing, because their
ids were composed from route display names instead of looked up. One of them caused data
loss: `wa_dragontail_peak_r4` and `wa_dragontail_peak_triple_couloirs` were flagged as a
duplicate pair, so the plan was "keep r4, delete triple_couloirs" — but r4 was not in the
live DB, so triple_couloirs was the only copy, and Triple Couloirs was destroyed. It was
rebuilt from `catalog/wa-alpine/routes.json`.

Two habits that follow from it: a duplicate flag is a hypothesis, so confirm **both** ids
return rows before deleting either half; and when anything may be writing concurrently,
write `col = coalesce(col, <value>)` so a restore can only fill blanks — a plain
assignment overwrote a richer `hazards` enrichment during that recovery.

### Route identity — why one peak's data keeps landing on another

Only ~9% of WA route ids are peak-scoped (`wa_mount_baker_north_ridge`, i.e. the id
starts with its `area_id`). The other ~91% are derived from the **route name** plus a
counter: `wa_north_ridge`, `wa_north_ridge_2`, `wa_north_face_3`, `wa_south_face`. So
"the North Ridge route" does not identify a peak — `wa_north_ridge*` spans Steeple Rock,
Whatcom, Cutthroat, Primus and Main Peak, and `wa_south_face` spans ten unrelated
formations.

That is the shared root cause of migrations 0044–0046 writing to nothing, of a Mount
Adams permit block appearing on Mount Baker and Forbidden, and of Guye Peak carrying two
copies of one route. **Peak names live on `areas.name`; route names are just the line.**

- Resolve route ids by joining through `areas`, and assert the target row's `area_id`
  is the peak you meant **before** writing. Never trust a name-shaped id.
- `npm run audit:identity -- --state wa` reports id-collision families, cross-region
  duplicate field values (the contamination fingerprint), and duplicate route rows.
  Run it after any enrichment or import batch.
- `npm run audit:distances -- --state wa` audits `routes.dist_km`. Read-only. It exists
  because **that column holds two conventions at once**: the app renders round trip as
  `distKm * 2`, so values are meant to be one-way, but 61 WA rows store *half a round
  trip* instead (the tell: only the doubled figure lands on a whole number of miles).
  Both populations display correctly, so **never normalize this column in bulk** — a
  blanket transform breaks as many rows as it fixes. The script also flags non-alpine
  routes filed under a peak's `area_id`; all 6 WA hits have `source: null`. A wide
  per-peak min/max spread is printed as context only: Rainier's 25x is legitimate, since
  Camp Muir and the Carbon River are different trailheads on one mountain.
- `route_duplicate_names` should return zero rows. As of `0065` it is a **materialized
  view**, so it is stale until refreshed — call `refresh_route_duplicate_names()` with the
  service key first, then read, or you will get a clean answer about yesterday's data.
  It was a plain view (`0062`, reworked in `0064`) until the live aggregate over 201k
  routes was measured at ~6s, which exceeds the 3s `statement_timeout` on the anon role:
  every read from the app returned `57014` while the same query looked healthy in the SQL
  editor, where the `postgres` role has no timeout. A guard that always errors is a guard
  you do not have.
- `id like 'wa_%'` is the reflex filter and it misses legacy ids like
  `stuart_west_ridge` — 6 WA routes today. Filter by the area subtree when a coverage
  percentage matters.

**The origin was one line in `scripts/pipeline/etl-state.mjs`**, which minted route ids as
`PREFIX + "_" + slug(route name)` while the crag id (`mid`) sat unused in the same
expression. `uniq()` then appended `_2`, `_3` in walk order, so the counter records nothing
but the order OpenBeta happened to be crawled. It now emits `mid + "_" + slug(name)`, and
`uniq` only fires for a genuine same-name-same-crag clash. `load-state.mjs` was never at
fault — it passes `r.id` straight through from `catalog/`.

> **Re-importing a legacy state would duplicate it, not update it.** `load-state.mjs`
> upserts with `Prefer: resolution=merge-duplicates`, which resolves on the PRIMARY KEY.
> Every route in an already-loaded state is stored under an old state-scoped id, so a
> re-run after the ETL fix hands PostgREST a *new* peak-scoped id and it INSERTs a second
> copy — 8,000+ rows for WA, ~200,000 catalog-wide.
