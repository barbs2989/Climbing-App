# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Commands

```bash
npm install        # install deps (React 18 + Vite)
npm run dev        # local dev server with HMR
npm run build      # production build to dist/
npm run preview    # serve the built dist/ locally
```

There is no test suite, linter, or type checker configured. Pushing to `main` (or `master`) triggers `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`, which builds and publishes `dist/` to GitHub Pages at https://barbs2989.github.io/Climbing-App/. `vite.config.js` sets `base: "/Climbing-App/"` to match the repo name — this must stay in sync with the repo name or asset links break on Pages.

## Architecture

This is **ClimbMatch**, a mobile-first social app for finding climbing partners, planning objectives, and sharing route conditions. The entire application is a single React component file.

- `index.html` → loads `main.jsx` → renders `<App/>` from `ClimbMatch.jsx`.
- **`ClimbMatch.jsx` (~2400 lines) is essentially the whole app.** It is written in a deliberately dense, single-line-per-declaration style (many `const`s and components packed onto one physical line). Expect very long lines; use `grep -n` with the symbol name rather than scrolling.

### A real Supabase backend exists, but most of the app still runs on in-memory seed data

A `USE_DB` flag (`lib/supabase.js`, on when `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`/`VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`/`VITE_USE_DB=true` are all set) gates a real DB path: `lib/db.js` (`useAreaRoutes`, `submitContribution`, `dbRouteToCamel`) and `lib/DbAreaBrowser.jsx` back the Climbs tab's area browser + route list from Supabase's `areas`/`routes` tables, which hold Washington's full alpine + rock catalog (thousands of routes — see `BACKEND.md` for the schema and pipeline). `lib/auth.js`/`lib/AuthModal.jsx` provide real login. See `BACKEND.md` for what's DB-backed vs. still simulated.

Everything else — crews, messages, connections, vouches, logs, trip reports, and any state outside a DB-backed route's own fields — is still **seeded from module-level `const` arrays/objects at the top of the file and lives only in React state for the session** (refreshing resets everything). Key seed data structures:

- `ROUTES` — the in-memory climbs fallback/demo set (each has an `id`, `mountainId`, grade, `activity`/trip reports, gear, hazards, GPX points, etc.). DB-backed routes bypass this via `dbRouteToCamel()`.
- `MOUNTAINS` — a **hierarchical area tree** (world → country → state → range → canyon → peak/crag/wall) linked by `parentId`, for the in-memory fallback. Routes reference areas via `mountainId`. `inArea(mid, sid)` walks parents to test membership; `areaPathNames(mid)` builds the breadcrumb. The DB-backed path uses the equivalent `areas`/`routes` tables and `ltree` instead.
- `CLIMBERS` / `FILLER_CLIMBERS` — other users; `ME` is the current user. Not migrated to the DB yet (see the note below on real profiles).
- `DEMO_FILLERS` — a boolean toggle that gates a lot of seed content (clubs, crews, my-climbs, etc.). Turning it off empties those sections.

`ME`, and the globals `UNITS` and `DLOCALE`, are **mutated directly** (not via `setState`) inside `App` — e.g. `ME.objectiveIds = wishlist` at the top of the component (~line 2212). Be aware that some state lives on these mutable module globals rather than purely in hooks.

> **Do not write to `ME` directly.** Profile/user state is owned by React hooks (`wishlist`, `myAvail`, `profile`, and the `editDraft`/`saveEdit` flow) — always update it through those setters (`setWishlist`, `setProfile`, etc.). The existing `ME.* = ...` assignments at ~line 2212 are a legacy sync hack that copies state back onto the global each render so the rest of the code can read `ME`; they are not a pattern to extend. Mutating `ME` directly is invisible to React, won't trigger a re-render, and creates a second source of truth that silently drifts from the hooks.

### The single `App` component

`export default function App()` (near the bottom, ~line 2208) holds **~100 `useState` hooks** and every screen. Navigation is driven by a single `tab` state string. Main tabs:

- `today` — home dashboard (greeting, recent condition reports, your crews, suggestions).
- `routes` — explore climbs by area, and (when `selRoute` is set) the route detail screen. Route detail has its own sub-`tab` state: `overview`, `conditions`, `planner`, `safety`, `photos`, `ranks`.
- `discover` — find partners or crews (`partnersMode` toggles `"partners"` / `"crews"`).
- `crew` — your crews and direct/crew messaging (`crewView`).
- `logbook` — your objectives, completed climbs, trip reports.
- `me` — profile, settings, verification, trust score.

`openRoute(x)` is the standard way to navigate into a route (sets `routeFrom`, `selRoute`, and `tab="routes"`).

### File layout within `ClimbMatch.jsx`

Read it in three bands:

1. **Top (~line 1–815): constants + pure helpers.** The `C` object is the shared dark-theme color palette used everywhere via inline styles (there are no CSS files or Tailwind). Domain helpers live here: `catOf`/`tripOf` (discipline categorization), `compat` (partner compatibility scoring), `scarfHrs`/`techHrs` (time estimates), `sunReadout`/`aspectDirs` (sun/shade by wall aspect and time of day), `buildConsensus` (aggregates trip reports into conditions consensus weighted by `trustScore`), `gpxDownload`, `passesFilters`, `distMiles`, `fuzzyMatch`.
2. **Middle: presentational components** — small functions like `DiscBadge`, `TrustBadge`, `VerifyBadge`, `RiskBadge`, `ProvenancePanel`, `RouteGearCheck`, `ElevChart`, `GPXMap`, `DiffRadar`, plus icon components (`DiscIcon`, `ActionIcon`).
3. **Bottom: `App`** — all stateful screen logic and the big inline-JSX render tree, gated by `tab===...` and `selRoute`.

### Domain concepts to know

- **Trust & safety** is a first-class theme: `trustScore`/`safetyScore`, vouches, belay catch ledgers, `VERIF` verification states, `RISK_LEVELS`, `SAFETY_ESSENTIALS`/`WATCH` (per-discipline safety advice), and float plans on crews.
- **Crews** are trip parties around a `routeId` with members, proposed `dates`/`dayAcks`, and a "Ready" state computed by `datesAgreed`/`agreedDate` (everyone confirmed + a day everyone acked).
- **Conditions consensus** is derived, not stored: `buildConsensus(route.activity)` weights reports by reporter trust and recency (`RECENT_DAYS`, `isRecent`) and extracts top condition tags, hazards (`HAZARD_TAGS`), and best months.

### Key algorithms (the computational core)

Four functions do the real work; everything else is UI around them. The code is the source of truth for the exact constants/formulas — these are just pointers.

- `compat(a, b)` (~L335) — partner compatibility score (clamped 20–99) from shared disciplines, grade closeness, shared objectives, verification, pace (`hikingSpeedFtHr`), and availability overlap.
- `buildConsensus(activity)` (~L344) — distills a route's trip reports into a conditions summary, weighting each report by the author's `trustScore` and recency; separates all-time vs recent tags and surfaces hazards.
- `datesAgreed(c)` / `agreedDate(c)` (~L382/384) — a crew reaches "Ready" only when every confirmed member (including ME = id `0`) has acked the same proposed day (`dayAcks`).
- `scarfHrs(...)` + `techHrs(...)` (~L336/337) — planner time estimates: Naismith-style approach time (fitness tier + pack weight) plus pitch-by-pitch climbing time (exponential slowdown by grade).

## Working in this codebase

- When adding a feature, follow the existing pattern: add seed data to the relevant top-level `const`, add `useState` in `App`, and add a `tab===...`/sub-view branch in the render tree. Match the dense, inline-style formatting of surrounding code.
- Styling is always inline `style={{...}}` referencing the `C` palette — do not introduce CSS files or a styling library.
- For anything outside the DB-backed routes/areas/contributions/auth path (crews, messages, connections, vouches, logs, trip reports, etc.), "saving" means updating React state — don't reach for storage APIs unless explicitly asked to add persistence. For DB-backed data, use the existing `lib/db.js`/`lib/supabase.js` patterns (e.g. `submitContribution`) rather than writing new ad-hoc persistence.
